# This exercise was challenging. The parts I had the most trouble with were writing the code in PyPoll so that it ran on any similar data set, rather than soley on a set list of candidate names I put in the dictionary. I had to google how to pull the number of votes for each candidate out of the dictionary once I appended the names from the csv file. The other part I had trouble with was writing and outputting the data into a text file. In class we went over how to write it to a csv file, but I don't believe we went over how to output the print/out statements.
